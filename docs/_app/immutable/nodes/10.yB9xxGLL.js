It follows the official cascade algorithm step by step, giving you complete transparency into why a particular style is applied.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">The Matching Process</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">First, the simulator checks which rules actually apply to the target element. It examines the element type, ID, and classes to determine matches. Only rules that match proceed to the next stage.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Specificity Comparison</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">For each matching rule, it calculates the three-part specificity score. It counts IDs, then classes and similar selectors, then element selectors. These scores are compared from left to right exactly as browsers do.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Final Tiebreaker</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">When two rules have identical specificity, the simulator uses source order. The rule that appears later in the input wins, just like in real CSS files.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Complete Transparency</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Every step is shown clearly. You see which rules matched, their exact specificity scores, and which one won. This removes all mystery from CSS behavior and helps you debug styling issues instantly.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">The simulator handles compound selectors, source order ties, and edge cases accurately. It is a faithful recreation of browser behavior in a simple, educational interface.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-q8x3kg">See exactly what the browser sees — no more guessing.</p></article></div>');function H(h){var e=w();x("q8x3kg",u=>{var a=k(),g=d(v(a),6);t(4),o(()=>c(g,"content",`${n??""}/blog/posts/post6`)),y(()=>{f.title="How This Simulator Calculates the Winner | CSS Cascade Simulator"}),r(u,a)});var s=l(e),m=l(s);t(4),i(s),t(2),i(e),o(()=>c(m,"href",`${n??""}/blog`)),r(h,e)}export{H as component,W as universal};
