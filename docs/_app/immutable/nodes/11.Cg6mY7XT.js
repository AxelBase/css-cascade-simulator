The most common source of bugs is unintended specificity conflicts. Following proven practices eliminates these problems and makes styling enjoyable again.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Keep Specificity Low and Flat</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Avoid using ID selectors for styling whenever possible. Reserve them for JavaScript hooks only. Stick to single-class selectors as much as you can. This creates a flat specificity landscape where rules are easy to override.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Never Fight the Cascade</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Instead of writing more specific selectors to override previous ones, restructure your HTML or classes. Adding more weight just to win creates technical debt that grows over time.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Use Naming Conventions</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Systems like BEM help by making class intent clear and preventing accidental overlaps. Even simple, consistent naming reduces confusion dramatically.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Leverage Cascade Intentionally</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Let inheritance do the work for shared properties like font and color. Use specific selectors only for exceptions. This reduces duplication and makes changes easier.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Test with Tools</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Regularly use simulators like this one to verify your assumptions. Seeing the cascade in action prevents surprises before they reach production.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Following these principles results in CSS that is readable, maintainable, and resilient to change.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-jo8es1">Great CSS is intentional, not accidental.</p></article></div>');function x(d){var e=_();b("jo8es1",v=>{var a=j(),h=u(g(a),6);s(4),i(()=>c(h,"content",`${n??""}/blog/posts/post7`)),f(()=>{y.title="Best Practices for Predictable CSS | CSS Cascade Simulator"}),o(v,a)});var t=r(e),m=r(t);s(4),l(t),s(2),l(e),i(()=>c(m,"href",`${n??""}/blog`)),o(d,e)}export{x as component,L as universal};
