While they are indeed the lowest-weight selector type, they are far from useless. In fact, they often become the deciding factor in the cascade when all other parts of specificity are equal.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">When the Element Wins</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">The element selector contributes to the third position in the specificity score. When two competing rules have the same number of IDs and the same number of classes, the one that includes an element selector wins. This is true even if the other rule appears later in the stylesheet.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">For example, a rule targeting header with a class will lose to div with header with the same class, because the presence of div adds one point to the final position. This subtle difference can be the reason a style unexpectedly applies or fails to apply.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">Real-World Scenarios</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">In large projects, it is common to see rules like .card-title and h2.card-title competing. If both have one class selector, the version with the element selector wins every time. This behavior catches many developers off guard because they assume source order should dominate.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">Strategic Advantage</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Smart developers use this knowledge intentionally. Adding an element selector is a lightweight way to increase specificity without introducing classes or IDs. It keeps the selector readable while giving it just enough weight to win in tight situations.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">This simulator makes these edge cases visible instantly. You can see exactly how adding or removing a simple element name changes the outcome of the cascade.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-led0iy">Never underestimate the quiet strength of the element selector.</p></article></div>');function j(d){var e=S();w("led0iy",m=>{var a=_(),v=y(u(a),6);t(4),l(()=>n(v,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post4`)),f(()=>{g.title="The Hidden Power of the Element Selector | CSS Cascade Simulator"}),i(m,a)});var s=o(e),p=o(s);t(4),r(s),t(2),r(e),l(()=>n(p,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),i(d,e)}export{j as component,W as universal};
