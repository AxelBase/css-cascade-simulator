When these different types are used together, they create a specificity score that is extremely difficult to override without using equally complex selectors.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">The Power of Combination</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Each part of a compound selector contributes to the final score. An element selector adds to the third number, a class adds to the second, and an ID adds to the first. Even one ID in a compound selector gives it massive weight because the first number dominates all comparisons.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">For example, a rule targeting div with header and .active has one ID, two classes, and one element. This creates a specificity far higher than any rule using only classes or elements, no matter how many there are.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Real-World Impact</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">In practice, this means a single carefully written compound selector can override entire utility frameworks or component libraries. This is both powerful and dangerous. It allows precise targeting but can make styles hard to override later.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Strategic Use</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Developers use compound selectors when they need absolute confidence that a style will apply. They are common in critical UI components like headers, navigation, or modals where visual consistency is essential.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">However, overusing them leads to specificity wars where increasingly complex selectors are needed to override previous ones. The best practice is to use them intentionally and sparingly.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">This simulator lets you see exactly how these combinations affect the cascade outcome in real time.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1al8b51">One smart compound selector can beat a thousand simple ones.</p></article></div>');function P(m){var e=C();g("1al8b51",h=>{var s=_(),u=v(b(s),6);t(4),r(()=>i(u,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post3`)),f(()=>{y.title="Compound Selectors: When Element + ID + Class Wins Everything | CSS Cascade Simulator"}),o(h,s)});var a=l(e),d=l(a);t(4),n(a),t(2),n(e),r(()=>i(d,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),o(m,e)}export{P as component,T as universal};
